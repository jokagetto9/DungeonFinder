I've created unique set of quests as an alternate way to summon Daedric princes. When arriving at a dungeon you may receive a quest to explore every dungeon of that type in the region. Completing enough quests of the same type will allow you summon the associated Daedric prince without any chance of failure. My goal is to give you reason to explore each region and conquer far more dungeons. There are 91 of these quests!

Here are the associations and the number of dungeons needed to summon:

Crypts			Vaernima	30	
Orc Stronghold		Boethiah	24
Human Stronghold	Clavicus Vile	25
Prisons			Mehrunes 	21
Desecrated Temples	Azura		27
Natural Cave		Meridia		29
Covens			Nocturnal	29
Vampire Haunts		Mephala		29
Laboratories		Hermaeus Mora	31
Harpy Nests		Hircine		20
Ruined Castles		Namira		36
Spider Nests		Malacath	30
Giant StrongHolds	Molag Bal	30
Dragon Dens		Peryite		29
Barbarian Stronghold	Sanguine 	20
Volcanic Caves		Peryite		29
Scorpion Nests		Malacath	30

You can only do one quest at a time. There is no time limit. 
You will receive the quest when arriving at a location. 
You will not receive the quest if you already have a dungeon of the same type assigned to another quest.
You will automatically receive the quest to summon the Daedric prince once you reach the target number.
If you somehow cancel the quest to summon a Daedric prince, it can be restarted by going to a cult shrine.

You will also receive 15 legal rep in that region and 1000-2000 gold per dungeon for completing the quest.

Currently, you will also be able to do the Daedric summoning the normal as well in order to get 2 rewards, but this will likely be changed in the future.
